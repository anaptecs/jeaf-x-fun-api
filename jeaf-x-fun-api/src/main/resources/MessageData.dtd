<!-- 
     Definition of the root element. The root element has exactly one message folder as child and one element containing 
     all information that are required to generate the appropriate java class.
-->
<!ELEMENT Root (ClassInfo?, ApplicationInfo?, MessageFolder+)>

<!-- 
     Element contains all information that are required to generate a java class that is used to access the messages 
     that are defined within the corresponding xml file. The generated java class will only contain a set of constants 
     that can be used to identify a defined message. The message text itself will not be generated to this class, so 
     that the messages can be changed without changing the code. This element is optional and only has to be defined in 
     the case that the set of constants should be generated.
     
     Attributes:
     - className Name of the class that should be generated. The attribute must be set. Together with attribute 
       'package' this attribute defines the fully qualified class name.
     
     - package Name of the package to which the class belongs. The attribute must be set. Together with attribute 
       'className' this attribute defines the fully qualified class name.
       
     - description Javadoc description that describes the generated class. The attribute is optional.
       
     - author Value for javadoc author tag (@author).
     
     - version Value for javadoc version tag (@version).

<!-- 
     Definition of the message folder element. A message folder can contain other message folders as well as simple 
     messages. A message folder is only relevant to structure the messages, but does not impact the generated 
     constants.
     
     Attributes:
     - name Name of the message folder as it will be displayed in the configuration utility. The attribute is 
       required.
     
     - idRangeBegin Lowest number that can be used as message id for all messages within this folder. The attribute 
       defines the lower border for valid message id values.

     - idRangeEnd Highest number that can be used as message id for all messages within this folder. The attribute 
       defines the upper border for valid message id values.

<!-- 
     Definition of a message element. For each message element an appropriate constant will be generated in the java 
     class. The message text itself will not be generated to this class, so that the messages can be changed without 
     changing the code. In order to support customized messages for different countries and languages this element may 
     have multiple sub nodes containing message texts.
     
     Attributes:
     - messageID ID of the message. The attribute must contain only numbers since, within the generated class integer 
       values for message ids are used. The attribute is required.
     
     - name Name identifying the message. This name is used as name for the constant in generated java class. The 
       attribute is required.
       
     - type Attribute sets the type of a message. Currently a message can either be a "regular" message (INFO) or an 
       error message (ERROR). The third option is that an element describes localized text. The attribute is required.
       
     - defaultText Default text of the message. The message text can be parameterized as defined by JDK class 
       java.text.MessageFormat. The default message text is used whenever no customized message for the specific locale
       is available. The attribute is required.
       
     - description Description of the message. This description is used as javadoc comment in the generated class. The
       attribute is required.
       
     - traceLevel Trace level of the message. It is used to log the message on the required level. The default value is 
       ERROR.

     Definition of the message text element for a special locale. These optional elements can be used to provide message
     texts that are customized for a specific locale.
     
     Attributes:
     - language Language for which the locale specific message text should be used. The attribute is required.
     
     - country Country for which the locale specific message text should be used. The attribute is optional if no 
       specific locale variant is defined.

       this attribute is set also the "country" must be set.
