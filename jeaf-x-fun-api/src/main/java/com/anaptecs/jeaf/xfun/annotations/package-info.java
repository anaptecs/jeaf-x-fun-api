/**
 * Package contains all annotations of JEAF X-Fun. These annotations can be used to configure JEAF X-Fun. If some
 * configuration parameters are not provided then default values will be used.
 * 
 * In order to make configuration even simpler JEAF's Maven Plugin can be used. The plugin analyzes the projects
 * classpath for classes with annotations and generates the required configuration files for JEAF X-Fun and other JEAF
 * modules.
